# How to learn Programming and PHP?

## The Outline

1. Basic execution and data flow control
2. Functions and identifying subproblems. Data modelling
3. Revision control systems and working in a team and security. This is the
   point where you implement your first "large" project. MUST be in a team. No
   lone wolves which cannot cooperate pass this
4. Object oriented concepts and principles - really, only OOP, not frameworks
   (keep reading)
5. Rewrite the first project in OOP, let's call this "project 2"
6. Identify reusable code and create a sepparate library (not framework) which
   can be reused in future projects ("project 3")
7. Learn design patterns, rewrite "project 3" as a framework, this is "project
   4"
8. Rewrite "project 1" on top of the framework "project 4"
9. Try out a few frameworks, see how others do stuff. Read about different
   technologies you haven't come across yet, like XML (both SAX and DOM),
   XPath, XSLT, SOAP, REST,
10. Other programming languages, C, PHP internals.

Timeline (40 hours a week) in weeks:

* 1: 4
* 2: 4
* 3: 12
* 4: 3
* 5: 6
* 6: 5
* 7: 8
* 8: 2
* 9: 8
* 10: 12

Total, minimum weeks to learn: 64 weeks. That's a year and 3 months.

Provided you know how to learn, you're smart, agile, and you really study
8 hours a day during week days.

Note: you won't be that hard-working, so I'll throw in 2 years minimal study
time.

After this, you're ready to start learning programming. Oh, wait...
