Wiki
====

PHP Programmers is a community of PHP Programmers from all around the globe. We love to work with PHP and we love to share knowledge and resources with each other. The idea with this wiki is to gather all of our knowledge in one place for easier access. Everything you see here is built in collaboration with members of the community, but we are looking for more contributors to extend this wiki with effective contents.
