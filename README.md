Wiki
====

PHP Programmers is a community of PHP Programmers from all around the globe. We
love to work with PHP and we love to share knowledge and resources with each
other. The idea with this wiki is to gather all of our knowledge in one place
for easier access. Everything you see here is built in collaboration with
members of the community, but we are looking for more contributors to extend
this wiki with effective contents.
